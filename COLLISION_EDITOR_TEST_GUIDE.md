## 🎮 Detailed Testing Steps

### Test 1: Create Building Collision

**Goal**: Make the center area (where you drew the box) a solid obstacle

1. **Open Editor**:

    - ESC → Collision Editor

2. **Draw Collision**:

    - Click [⬜ Draw Box]
    - Click canvas at approximately the center-left area
    - Click again to the right to create a rectangle
    - Red box appears ✅

3. **Verify in Right Panel**:

    - Right panel shows: "Collision Box 1"
    - Shows coordinates like "(42.5%, 45.3%)"

4. **Save**:

    - Click [💿 Save to Browser]
    - Alert appears: "Collision data saved!"

5. **Close & Reload**:

    - Click [✕] to close editor
    - Press F5 to reload page
    - OR: ESC → Restart Game

6. **Watch Console**:

    - Open browser console (F12)
    - You should see:
        ```
        Loading collision data...
        Created 1 collision shapes for BarangayMap
        Player collision enabled with 1 collision shapes
        ```

7. **Test Collision**:
    - Walk player towards the area
    - Player stops! Can't pass through! ✅

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) and look for these messages:

```
✅ "Loading collision data..."
✅ "Created rectangle collision 'Collision Box 1' at (42%, 45%)"
✅ "Created 1 collision shapes for BarangayMap"
✅ "Player collision enabled with 1 collision shapes"
```

If you see these, **collisions are working!** ✅

### Physical Test

1. **Note the collision location**: Remember where you drew it (e.g., center area)
2. **Walk there**: Move your player to that area
3. **Hit the boundary**: Player should stop
4. **Try all sides**: Test collision from top, bottom, left, right
5. **Confirm solid**: Can't pass through from any direction ✅

---

## 🎯 Advanced Testing

### Test 2: Multiple Collisions

1. Open Collision Editor
2. Draw 3-5 different collision boxes around the map
3. Save to browser
4. Reload game
5. Test each collision - all should work!

### Test 3: Polygon Collision (Free-Form)

1. Open Collision Editor
2. Click [🔷 Draw Polygon]
3. Click 4-5 points to create an irregular shape
4. Click [✅ Finish Polygon]
5. Blue polygon appears
6. Save to browser
7. Reload game
8. Walk to that area - polygon collision works! ✅

### Test 4: Circle Collision (Trees)

1. Open Collision Editor
2. Click [⭕ Draw Circle]
3. Click center point
4. Click edge point (sets radius)
5. Green circle appears
6. Save to browser
7. Reload game
8. Walk to that area - can't pass through circle! ✅

## 🗺️ Recommended Test Scenario

### Create Realistic Building Collision

**Let's make an NPC area "solid"**:

1. **Find an NPC location**:

    - Look at your `missionLocations` in BarangayMap.ts
    - Example: Barangay Captain at (29%, 21%)

2. **Open Collision Editor**:

    - ESC → Collision Editor

3. **Draw around the NPC area**:

    - Click [⬜ Draw Box]
    - Click at (~27%, 19%) - slightly before NPC
    - Click at (~31%, 23%) - slightly after NPC
    - This creates a 4x4% collision box

4. **Save**:

    - Click [💿 Save to Browser]

5. **Reload & Test**:
    - Reload game (F5)
    - Walk towards that NPC
    - You'll hit the collision before reaching them!
    - The area is now "solid" ✅

## 🎨 Visual Debug (See Collisions)

Want to SEE the collision boxes in-game? Add this temporary debug code:

```typescript
// In BarangayMap.ts, inside loadCollisions() method after creating collisions:

if (collisionData && this.backgroundImage) {
    console.log("Loading collision data...");
    this.collisionBodies = collisionService.createCollisions(
        this,
        collisionData,
        this.backgroundImage
    );

    // 🎨 ADD THIS: Visual debug for collisions
    collisionData.shapes.forEach((shape) => {
        if (shape.type === "rectangle") {
            const box = shape as any;
            const coords = this.percentageToWorldCoordinates(
                box.percentX + box.percentWidth / 2,
                box.percentY + box.percentHeight / 2
            );
            const width =
                (box.percentWidth / 100) * this.backgroundImage.displayWidth;
            const height =
                (box.percentHeight / 100) * this.backgroundImage.displayHeight;

            // Draw debug rectangle (red outline)
            const debugRect = this.add.rectangle(
                coords.x,
                coords.y,
                width,
                height,
                0xff0000,
                0 // Transparent fill
            );
            debugRect.setStrokeStyle(3, 0xff0000); // Red outline
            debugRect.setDepth(1000); // Above everything
        }
    });
    // 🎨 END DEBUG CODE

    if (this.collisionBodies && this.player) {
        this.physics.add.collider(this.player, this.collisionBodies);
        console.log(
            `Player collision enabled with ${collisionData.shapes.length} collision shapes`
        );
    }
}
```

Now you'll **SEE red outlines** where your collisions are! 🎨

## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When You Save in Editor:

```javascript
collisionData = {
    mapName: "BarangayMap",
    shapes: [
        {
            id: "box-1234567890",
            type: "rectangle",
            percentX: 42.5,
            percentY: 45.3,
            percentWidth: 10.0,
            percentHeight: 8.0,
        },
    ],
};

localStorage.setItem(
    "mathtuto-collision-BarangayMap",
    JSON.stringify(collisionData)
);
```

### When Game Loads (BarangayMap scene):

```typescript
// 1. loadCollisions() is called
const collisionData = localStorage.getItem("mathtuto-collision-BarangayMap");

// 2. Convert % to world coordinates
const worldX = bgLeft + (42.5 / 100) * bgWidth; // e.g., 850
const worldY = bgTop + (45.3 / 100) * bgHeight; // e.g., 543

// 3. Create Phaser rectangle
const collision = this.add.rectangle(worldX, worldY, width, height);

// 4. Make it static physics body
this.physics.add.existing(collision, true);

// 5. Add collision with player
this.physics.add.collider(this.player, collision);

// ✅ Now player can't pass through!
```

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see collisions working!"

**Check 1: Did you save?**

```
Collision Editor → [💿 Save to Browser] → Alert should appear
```

**Check 2: Did you reload?**

```
After saving, press F5 or restart game
Collisions only load when scene starts!
```

**Check 3: Check console logs**

```
F12 → Console
Look for: "Loading collision data..."
If you see "No collision data found" → You didn't save!
```

**Check 4: Is collision in right place?**

```
Open editor again
Verify collision is where you think it is
Coordinates shown in right panel
```

### "Console shows 'No collision data found'"

**Problem**: Data not saved properly

**Solution**:

1. Open Collision Editor
2. Draw a shape
3. Click [💿 Save to Browser]
4. Verify alert appears
5. Close editor
6. Check localStorage:

    - Look for key: `mathtuto-collision-BarangayMap`
    - Should have JSON data

### "Collision works but in wrong place"

**Problem**: Drew collision in wrong location

**Solution**:

1. Open Collision Editor
2. You'll see your existing collision
3. Click [↖️ Select]
4. Click the shape to select it
5. Click [🗑️ Delete Selected]

    ```

---

## 🎨 Visual Verification (Optional)

### Add Debug Visualization

If you want to **SEE** the collision boxes in red:

1. **Open**: `src/game/scenes/BarangayMap.ts`

2. **Find**: The `loadCollisions()` method (line ~3287)

3. **Add this code** right after `this.collisionBodies = collisionService.createCollisions(...)`:

```typescript
// 🎨 DEBUG: Visualize collisions in-game
if (collisionData) {
    collisionData.shapes.forEach((shape) => {
        if (shape.type === "rectangle") {
            const box = shape as any;
            const coords = this.percentageToWorldCoordinates(
                box.percentX + box.percentWidth / 2,
                box.percentY + box.percentHeight / 2
            );
            const width =
                (box.percentWidth / 100) * this.backgroundImage.displayWidth;
            const height =
                (box.percentHeight / 100) * this.backgroundImage.displayHeight;

            const debugRect = this.add.rectangle(
                coords.x,
                coords.y,
                width,
                height,
                0xff0000,
                0
            );
            debugRect.setStrokeStyle(3, 0xff0000);
            debugRect.setDepth(1000);

            console.log(`🎨 Debug: Visualized collision "${box.name}" in red`);
        }
    });
}
```

4. **Save the file**

5. **Reload game**

6. **Now you'll see RED RECTANGLES** where your collisions are!

7. **Player still can't pass through them** ✅

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### After Drawing 1 Collision Box:

**In Editor**:

-   ✅ Red rectangle visible on canvas
-   ✅ "Collision Box 1" in right panel
-   ✅ Coordinates shown (e.g., "42%, 45%")

**After Save**:

-   ✅ Alert: "Collision data saved!"
-   ✅ localStorage has data (check F12 → Application)

**After Reload**:

-   ✅ Console: "Loading collision data..."
-   ✅ Console: "Created 1 collision shapes..."
-   ✅ Console: "Player collision enabled..."

**In-Game**:

-   ✅ Player stops at collision boundary
-   ✅ Can't walk through from any direction
-   ✅ Can walk around the collision
-   ✅ Collision is invisible (unless debug code added)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### After Confirming It Works:

1. **Delete test collision**:

    ```
    ESC → Collision Editor
    Select shape → [🗑️ Delete Selected]
    Save to browser
    ```

2. **Create real collisions**:

    ```
    Draw collision boxes for actual buildings
    Match building sprites on your background
    Save to browser
    Test each one!
    ```

3. **Export for production**:
    ```
    [💾 Download JSON]
    → barangaymap-collisions.json
    Place in public/ folder
    Ship with game!
    ```
