4. **Achievement**: Provides tangible rewards (titles)
5. **Community**: Creates shared secrets players can discuss
6. **Skill Expression**: Rewards different playstyles (speed, collection, social)

### Balance Considerations

- **Not Required**: Secret quests are optional
- **Hints Provided**: Cryptic but fair hints

- **Varied Difficulty**: Something for everyone
- **No FOMO**: Can always come back later
